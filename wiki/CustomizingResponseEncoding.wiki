== Customizing response encoding ==

= Introduction =

JSON web service support changing/customizing your response content and encoding. 

Use case: Post JSON request and result is in HTML, PDF, or other response, but not default JSON. Response content produced using result of your implementation operation.


NOT USED FOR:

1) If you have use case: customize only specific Object in json response, This is NOT correct way. Look at Custom serializer.
2) If you have use case: diffident content/type produced by other service and like to send to json web service, client consider using attachment.


How it different from JSON/SOAP attachment?

1) Content Type:

ATTACHMENT: Attachment always produce multipart/mime response with your main part as JSON and attachments are following part with relevant content type. 
CUSTOM ENCODER: Custom encoder give control to developer to specify main content type. Encoder responsible for response header/body.

2) Resource Access:

ATTACHMENT: In attachment, Attachment done inside implementation method. Developer have control/access to all resource or operations.
CUSTOM ENCODER: Custom encoder called only after operation completed. Encoder can access only result of operation.
